<h1 class="topictitle1">Network encryption and authentication with SSL/TLS</h1>



<div><p>By default, all
<span>Derby</span> network traffic is
unencrypted, with the exception of user names and user passwords, which may be
encrypted separately.</p>

<p>See <a href="cadminappsclientsecurity.html#cadminappsclientsecurity">Network client security</a> for more
information.</p>

<p>There is also no network layer access control mechanism. For deployment
scenarios where these are possible security issues, the <span>Derby</span> Network Server supports
network security with Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security
(SSL/TLS).</p>

<p>With SSL/TLS, the client/server communication protocol is encrypted, and
both the client and the server may, independently of each other, require
certificate-based authentication of the other part.</p>

<p>It is assumed that the reader is somewhat familiar with SSL, key pairs, and
certificates. This documentation is also based on the Java Development Kit (JDK)
and its <samp class="codeph">keytool</samp> application.</p>

<p>For the remainder of this section, the term <em>SSL</em> is used for SSL/TLS,
and the term <em>peer</em> is used for the other part of the communication (the
server's <em>peer</em> is the client and vice versa).</p>

<div class="p">SSL for <span>Derby</span> (both for
client and for server) operates in three possible modes:
<dl>
<dt class="dlterm"><strong>off</strong></dt>
<dd>The default, no SSL encryption</dd>

<dt class="dlterm"><strong>basic</strong></dt>
<dd>SSL encryption, no peer authentication</dd>

<dt class="dlterm"><strong>peerAuthentication</strong></dt>
<dd>SSL encryption and peer authentication</dd>

</dl>

</div>

<p>Peer authentication may be set on the server, on the client, or on both. Peer
authentication means that the other side of the SSL connection is authenticated
based on a trusted certificate installed locally.</p>

<p>Alternatively, a Certification Authority (CA) certificate may be installed
locally and the peer has a certificate signed by that authority. How to achieve
this is not described in this document. Consult your Java environment
documentation for details on this.</p>

<div class="p">
<div class="attention"><span class="attentiontitle">Attention: </span>
<em>If a plaintext client tries to communicate with an SSL server, or if an
SSL client tries to communicate with a plaintext server, the plaintext
side of the communication will see the SSL communication as noise and
report protocol errors.</em>

<ul class="ullinks">
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cadminsslkeys.html">Key and certificate handling</a></strong><br />
For SSL operation, the server always needs a key pair. If the server runs in peer authentication mode (the server authenticates the clients), each client needs its own key pair. In general, if one end of the communication wants to authenticate its partner, the first end needs to install a certificate generated by the partner.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cadminsslserver.html">Starting the server with SSL/TLS</a></strong><br />
For server SSL/TLS, a server key pair needs to be generated. If the server is going to do client authentication, the client certificates need to be installed in the trust store.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cadminsslclient.html">Running the client with SSL/TLS</a></strong><br />
Basic SSL encryption on the client is enabled either by the URL attribute ssl, the property ssl, or the datasource attribute ssl set to basic.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cadminssladmin.html">Other server commands</a></strong><br />
The other server commands (shutdown, ping, sysinfo, runtimeinfo, logconnections, maxthreads, timeslice, trace, and tracedirectory) are implemented as clients, and they behave exactly as clients with regards to SSL.</li>
