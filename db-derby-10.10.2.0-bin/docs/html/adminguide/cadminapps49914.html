<h1 class="topictitle1">User authentication differences</h1>



<div><p>When you run <span>Derby</span>
in embedded mode or when you use the
<span>Derby</span> Network Server, you can
enable or disable server-side user authentication. However, when you use the
Network Server, the default security mechanism
(<samp class="codeph">CLEAR_TEXT_PASSWORD_SECURITY</samp>) requires that you supply both
the user name and password.</p>

<p>In addition to the default user name and password security mechanism,
<samp class="codeph">org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDataSource.CLEAR_TEXT_PASSWORD_SECURITY</samp>,
<span>Derby</span> Network Server supports
the following security properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>UserID (<samp class="codeph">org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDataSource.USER_ONLY_SECURITY</samp>)
<p>When you use this mechanism, you must specify only the <samp class="codeph">user</samp>
property. All other mechanisms require you to specify both the user name and the
password.</p>
</li>

<li>Encrypted UserID and encrypted password
(<samp class="codeph">org.apache.derby.jdbc.ClientDataSource.ENCRYPTED_USER_AND_PASSWORD_SECURITY</samp>)
<p>When you use this mechanism, both password and user id are encrypted.</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>The user name that is specified upon connection is the default schema for the
connection, if a schema with that name exists. See the
<span><em>Derby Developer's Guide</em></span> for more information on schema
and user names.</p>

<p>If you specify any other security mechanism, you will receive an
exception.</p>

<p>To change the default, you can specify another security mechanism either as a
property or on the URL (using the <samp class="codeph">securityMechanism=value</samp>
attribute) when you make the connection. For details, see
<a href="cadminappsclientsecurity.html#cadminappsclientsecurity">Network client security</a> and
"securityMechanism=value attribute" in the 
<span><em>Derby Reference Manual</em></span>.</p>

<p>Whether the security mechanism you specify for the client actually takes
effect depends upon the setting of the 
<samp class="codeph">derby.drda.securityMechanism</samp> property for the Network Server. 
If the <samp class="codeph">derby.drda.securityMechanism</samp> property is set, the 
Network Server accepts only connections that use the security mechanism 
specified by the property setting. If the 
<samp class="codeph">derby.drda.securityMechanism</samp> property is not set, clients can
use any valid security mechanism. For details, see 
<a href="radmindrdasecmechanism.html#radmindrdasecmechanism">derby.drda.securityMechanism property</a>.</p>

<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cadminapps811631.html">Security mechanism options when user authentication is enabled on the Network Server</a></strong><br />
When user authentication is enabled in Derby, you can use either of the following security mechanisms.</li>
<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cadminapps811656.html">Security mechanism options when user authentication is disabled on the Network Server</a></strong><br />

<li class="ulchildlink"><strong><a href="cadminapps811695.html">Enabling the encrypted user ID and password security mechanism</a></strong><br />
To use the encrypted user ID and password security mechanism, you need a Java environment with a JCE (Java Cryptography Extension) which supports the Diffie-Hellman algorithm with a public prime of 256 bits.</li>
