<h1 class="topictitle1">Network Server security</h1>



<div><p>By default, the
<span>Derby</span> Network Server listens
only on the localhost. Clients must use the localhost host name to
connect.</p>

<p>By default, clients cannot access the Network Server from another host. To
enable connections from other hosts, set the <samp class="codeph">derby.drda.host</samp>
property, or start the Network Server with the <samp class="codeph">-h</samp> option
in the <samp class="codeph">java org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl start</samp>
command.</p>

<p>In the following example, the server will listen only on the localhost, and
clients cannot access the server from another host:</p>

<pre><strong>java org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl start</strong></pre>

<p>In the following example, the server runs on the host machine
<samp class="codeph">sampleserver.example.com</samp> and also listens for clients
from other hosts. Clients must specify the server in the URL or DataSource as
<samp class="codeph">sampleserver.example.com</samp>:</p>

<pre><strong>java org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl start 
   -h sampleserver.example.com</strong></pre>

<p>To start the Network Server so that it will listen on all interfaces, start
with an IP address of <samp class="codeph">0.0.0.0</samp>, as shown in the following
example:</p>

<pre><strong>java org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl start -h 0.0.0.0</strong></pre>

<p>A server that is started with the <samp class="codeph">-h 0.0.0.0</samp> option will
listen to client requests that originate from both <samp class="codeph">localhost</samp>
and from other machines on the network.</p>

<p>However, administrative commands (for example,
<samp class="codeph">org.apache.derby.drda.NetworkServerControl shutdown</samp>) can run
only on the host where the server was started, even if the server was started
with the <samp class="codeph">-h</samp> option.</p>
