<P><B>Graph 1.0</B> - Gerd Wagner</P>
<P>The Graph plugin allows to create charts of tables and foreign-key
relationships. 
</P>
<P><IMG SRC="graph.png" NAME="Graphic5" ALIGN=LEFT BORDER=0><BR CLEAR=LEFT><BR><BR>
</P>
<P>To create a graph select the tables in the Object tree and click
the 'Add to graph' item in the right mouse menu. Right mouse click
tables, constraints as well as the background to find out what
functions the Graph provides. To open a table a foreign key points to
just double click on the foreign key column. The plugin supports
browsing through the table structure.
Note: A Graph uses foreign keys to render dependency lines between fields in the tables.
So, a child column which is a member of a foreign key to a parent
primary key column in a different table will be shown on the graph
when both tables are added in such a way that the child column has a
line with an arrow pointing to the parent column.  So, if you want to
have the graph plugin show relationships visually, you must - for the
foreseeable future - define foreign keys using regular SQL in
SQuirreL.
</P>
<P>To distribute and print a graph to several sheets of paper click
the 'Zoom/Print' item in the backgrounds right mouse menu. The
control panel at the bottom of the Graph enables you to scale the
chart as well as the paper edges.</P>

<UL>
	<LI><P>You can have several Graph tabs and you can give them meaningful names and
	save them.  When the session is later re-opened, the previously saved graph tabs
	are restored.</P>
	<LI><P>The Graph plugin works best if you use the SQL Scripts plugin
	too. The SQL Scripts is available in the installer, or from within SQuirreL using
	the update feature.

<P><FONT SIZE=5>Query Builder</FONT></P>
<P>The Graph Plugin provides a Query Builder. Besides the default and
Zoom/Print modes described above Query Builder is a new mode of the
Graph Plugin. The Query Builder brings along several enhancements:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P>The user can define constraint lines using drag and drop on
	columns with shift key down. User defined constraint lines are of
	blue color and can be right clicked to be configured or removed.</P>
	<LI><P>Multiple tables can be selected (ctrl key down) and moved
	simultaneously.</P>
	<LI><P>A Graph can be viewed in separate window.</P>
	<LI><P>Tables can be dragged from the Object tree to a Graph window.
	For convenience there is a new Session tool bar button that creates
	a new Graph window and places it right besides the Session's Object
	tree.</P>
	<LI><P>Graphs have a Kick off/Start button on the lower left of a
	Graph panel to give more intuitive access to Graph functions.</P>
